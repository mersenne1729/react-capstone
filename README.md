#  Kardashev Scale

## Synopsis

I've made this to understand programing a littel and is designed to showcase the basics of Kardashev Scale concept, featuring a *YouTube* API.  

## Motivation

This project plays with the Kardashev Scale, which is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to cultivate. The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale. It was first proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, and various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a Type 0 and V. 

## Initial UX

The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

## Functionality

The site's functionality includes:

* Summaries of the relevant information for each level of the scale.
* A summary link to callable data via *YouTube* on the various scales.

## Technical

The site is built with React, Redux, Webpack, and jQuery. It makes use of JSON calls to the *YouTube* Open Platform API to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.
