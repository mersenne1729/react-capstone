## Motivation

This site is built to promote the Kardashev Scale, which is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to cultivate. The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale. It was first proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, and various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a Type 0 and V.
