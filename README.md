#  Kardashev scale

### Background
The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication. The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale. It was proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev. Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a high and lower range of levels (types 0 and V) and the use of metrics other than pure power production. 

## Use Case
What this app good for? The is a small and fun app that is good for anyone that has an interest in ideas of other civilizations and what some of great minds have connived of.

## Initial UX
The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

## Working Prototype
You can find a working prototype of the app here: 

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:

* Summaries of the relevant information for each level of the scale
* A summary link to callable data via *YouTube* on the various scales

## Technical
The app is built with React, HTML, CSS, Java Script and jQuery it makes use of JSON calls to the *YouTube* Open Platform APIs to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap
This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* a Complete redesign of the CSS and styling and the addition of other more information 
* Further enhancements include additional API request to relevant papers.
* The addition of a favourites sections that is exportable

## User stories
* As a student I want to know a little more about imagined technology.
* As a keen reader of sci-fi I want to read something fun, entertaining and authentic.
* I want to know more about some of the possible futures that have scientific credibility.
* As someone with a casual interest in science I want to be able to find out what the Kardashev scale is about.
